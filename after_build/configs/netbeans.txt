Name: vbox
Host Name: 192.168.100.10
User Name: vagrant
Password: vagrant
Private Key File: (path/to/wimp_build)/after_build/ppk_key/vagrant_key.ppk

-------------------

- Click Test Connection to make sure it configured correctly
- Click OK
- Below the Remote Connection setting, there is another one that says Upload Files
	(This will be how often to choose to upload files)
- Choose your method (I prefer: On Save)
- Below Upload Files, there are 2 check boxes
- Leave preserve remote empty
- Check Upload Files Directly
- Click Okay

Now when you save any file in the project, it will automatically be uploaded to your remote connection
This will work for the staging server too. You just have to configure it and give it a different name. 
Then you can use the options box to choose where to save files.

----------------------
KNOWN HOSTS FILE
This is for ssh purposes. You add it to keep the key response on file as trusted. This will keep
whatever program from asking over and over whether you trust the source.

To utilize this, browse to wherever you save your nb projects and create an empty file named "known_hosts.txt"

Now, whenever you connect to a new source, your response will be saved here if you want.
